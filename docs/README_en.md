This is a new module that replaces [**TwiFucker**](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/TwiFucker), which was developed and discarded.  
Both [LSPosed](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed) and [LSPatch](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPatch) are going to be supported.

  ・Download functionality, navigation bar, and custom app icons will be available
- Disable For You Tab
- Use system fonts with alphabet(Disable Chirp Font)
- Disable menu (space, image and GIF image options) when pressing the tweet button
- Elimination of the count of impressions
- Select a shared link([fxtwitter.com](https://github.com/FixTweet/FxTwitter), [vxtwitter.com](https://github.com/dylanpdx/BetterTwitFix) and others)

and things like that.
